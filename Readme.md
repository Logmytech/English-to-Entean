Here is an extract from http://hataraku.wikia.com/wiki/Ente_Isla

In the anime, the language in Ente Isla is called Entean, which is basically most of the consonants in the English alphabet switched around. Vowels and the consonants 'L', 'N', 'Q' keep their original position. ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ is changed to AZYXEWVTISRLPNOMQKJHUGFDCB.

For example, 'human' is 'tupan', and 'world' becomes 'foklx'.
